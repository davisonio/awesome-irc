# Contributing

I'm really glad you're reading this, because as you no doubt realize too, the "awesome sauce" which is the key ingredient to a truly `awesome-list` is: LOTS OF INPUT. So long as what you propose is rooted in a critically examined, strongly held opinion about some aspect of IRC, you can be sure that we will evaluate it as fairly as we can and respect the person behind it, even if we ultimately don't agree about it belonging here.

Personal experience leads me to believe that nowhere in the Universe is Hanlon's razor more applicable than on IRC, and in that spirit we try our best here not to "_attribute to villainy that which simply results from stupidity_." :smiling_imp:

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to awesome-irc](https://github.com/davisonio/awesome-irc/pull/new/master) with a clear one-line summary of what you think should be added, changed or removed and as much supporting commentary as you think will get us up to speed on why it's so awesome. :sunglasses: (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Passion and enthusiasm are always welcome so long as they're adequately chaperoned by reason and maturity, so make your best pitch; just be aware that our best form of quality control is healthy skepticism so there's never a guarantee of an easy "LGTM."

Specifically, if you're adding something new, make sure that it is [formatted correctly](#manual-of-style) and offers at least a hint of the awesomeness.

### Manual of Style

Your submission should hew rather closely to this syntax:

```md
- [Example IRC](https://example.com) - The best IRC client in the world. ([source](https://example.com), [etc.](https://example.com)) `Tag`
```

Which produces the formatting we've decided works best:

- [Example IRC](https://example.com) - The best IRC client in the world. ([source](https://example.com), [etc.](https://example.com)) `Tag`

### Coding conventions

Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one change to the list per commit).
